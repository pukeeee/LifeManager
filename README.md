## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Launch

### Prerequisites
- Installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <URL-of-your-repository>
cd LifeManagerBot
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with the following content:

```env
# Your Telegram bot token from @BotFather
TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN

# Your Telegram channel ID (e.g., @my_channel)
# The bot must be an administrator in this channel for the subscription check to work
CHANNEL=@your_channel
```

### 3. Telegram Channel Setup

For the subscription check feature to work correctly:
1. Create a public or private Telegram channel.
2. Add your bot to this channel.
3. Promote the bot to an **administrator** in the channel. Granting any permission (e.g., "Add Members") is sufficient for it to get the list of members.
4. Specify the channel ID (e.g., `@my_channel`) in the `CHANNEL` variable in your `.env` file.

### 4. Launching the project

After setting up the `.env` file, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
This command will automatically build the Docker images, launch the bot, database, and Redis containers, and create the necessary tables in the database.
